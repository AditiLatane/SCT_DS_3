Aim

Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Steps followed to find solution : 

1. Import libraries 

2. Load and inspect the dataset. 

3. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categories, etc.). 

4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets. 

5. Train the decision tree model. 

6. Visualize the decision tree. 

7. Evaluate the model using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
