Aim


Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.


Steps followed to find solution : 


Step 1: Import libraries

Step 2: Load and inspect the dataset.

Step 3: Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categories, etc.).

Step 4: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Step 5: Train the decision tree model.

Step 6: Visualize the decision tree.

Step 7: Evaluate the model using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
